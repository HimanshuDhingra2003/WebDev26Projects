Project Overview: Weather App

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

Key Components:

HTML Structure:

The project starts with an HTML structure that includes input fields for the city search, a search button, and containers to display weather information and error messages.
CSS Styling:

CSS styling is applied to create an appealing and responsive design for the app. It ensures that the user interface is visually engaging and easy to navigate.
JavaScript Logic:

JavaScript is used to handle the core functionality of the app.
The app uses fetch() to make API requests to OpenWeatherMap and retrieve weather data based on the user's input.
The retrieved data is processed and displayed in designated containers on the page.
Event Listeners:

Event listeners are set up to respond to user interactions.
The search button has an event listener attached to trigger the weather data retrieval when clicked.
Error Handling:

The app includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid city names or other potential errors during API requests.
If an invalid city is entered or an error occurs, the app displays an error message.
Display Weather Information:

When valid weather data is retrieved from the API, the app displays the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
The weather icon changes based on the current weather condition (e.g., clouds, rain, clear sky).
User Experience:

The app aims to provide a seamless user experience by updating the displayed information dynamically and responding to user interactions in real-time.
User Interaction:

City Search:

Users can enter the name of a city they want to get weather information for.
After entering the city name, users click the search button.
Weather Display:

If the entered city is valid, the app fetches and displays the current weather information.
The weather icon changes based on the weather condition.
Error Handling:

If an invalid city name is entered or an error occurs during the API request, the app displays an error message indicating the issue.
Project Goals:

The Weather App project aims to provide users with an intuitive interface to access current weather information for a chosen city. Through the use of the OpenWeatherMap API, the app retrieves accurate weather data and presents it in a visually appealing format. The inclusion of error handling ensures that users receive meaningful feedback, enhancing the overall user experience.
